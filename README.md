# CSV-Export-Feature

This React feature allows users to interact with a map by selecting a specific layer and downloading its data in CSV format. Key functionalities include:

      1. Layer Selection: Users can choose a layer from a dropdown menu populated with available layers from the map.
      2. Data Export: After selecting a layer, users can click a button to export the layer's data to a CSV file.
      3. Dynamic Query Handling: The widget intercepts and processes map queries to filter data based on user-defined criteria before exporting.
      
Overall, it facilitates the extraction and analysis of map layer data, making it easier to work with and analyze geospatial information.
